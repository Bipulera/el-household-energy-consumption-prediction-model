Project Explanation – Energy Consumption Forecasting with ETL + Time Series
1. 📂 About the Data

Dataset: Individual household electric power consumption dataset (UCI repository).

Source file: household_power_consumption.txt.

Time period: 2006 to 2010 (around 4 years of data).

Frequency: Data recorded every minute (later aggregated for daily analysis).

Features (columns):

Date & Time

Global_active_power (main target, i.e., household power usage in kilowatts)

Other readings like Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Sub_metering_1/2/3, etc.

👉 For simplicity, we focused mainly on Global_active_power as the measure of daily energy consumption.

2. ⚙️ ETL Pipeline

ETL = Extract → Transform → Load

Extract: Loaded raw .txt dataset into Pandas dataframe in Google Colab.

Transform:

Converted Date and Time into a proper datetime column.

Handled missing values (some rows had ?).

Aggregated data to daily averages (instead of minute-level, which is too large).

Load: Prepared a clean dataset ready for analysis & modeling.

This step shows you can handle raw messy data and prepare it for ML models (a very important skill interviewers like).

3. 📈 Time Series Forecasting Model

Model used: Facebook Prophet (now just “Prophet”).

Why Prophet?

Designed for time series forecasting.

Handles seasonality, trend, and holidays automatically.

Easy to implement in Colab.

Input: ds (date) and y (daily average of global active power).

Output: Forecast of future household energy usage.

4. 🔮 Prediction

Trained the model on historical data (2006–2010).

Generated forecast for future dates beyond 2010 (e.g., predicting for 2011 onwards).

Forecast plot shows:

Blue line = Predicted values (best guess).

Shaded region = Confidence interval (uncertainty range).

5. 🧠 How Prediction Works (Simplified)

Prophet learns:

Trend – long-term increase or decrease in energy usage.

Seasonality – daily/weekly/yearly repeating patterns (like higher usage in evenings or winters).

Noise – random fluctuations.

It combines all these to predict future usage.

6. 📊 Example Outcome

Suppose on 2011-01-01 the model predicts:

Forecast = 4.3 kWh

Confidence interval = [3.9, 4.8 kWh]

This means: the expected consumption is around 4.3, but it may realistically fall in that range.

7. 🌟 What Makes Your Project Strong

You didn’t just train a model — you built an ETL pipeline + forecasting system.

Shows end-to-end skills:

Data engineering (ETL)

Data science/ML (forecasting model)

Business insight (predicting future consumption helps energy planning).
